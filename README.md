# Stellaris-Data-Analysis-Project
Data Analysis Case Project on Stellaris Player-Created Civilizations
This is my capstone project from the Google Data Analytics Certificate.

## Project Overview
Analyzed 122 custom race builds from the game Stellaris to extract trends, preferences, and potential DLC ideas from a game development perspective.

## Tools Used
- Excel (data cleaning, data validation, JOINs, SORTs, TRANSPOSE, VLOOKUP, nested IFs)
- Pivot Tables, Charts
- Google Slides (presentation)

## Key Findings
- Common inspiration sources are pop-culture Sci-Fi and popular gaming franchises (predominantly those that feature multiple different factions)
- Player style tends towards Authoritarian Governments with Ethics favouring the Militarist Ethic. This suggests a high propensity towards aggressive gameplay externally while avoiding internal issues such as elections or political parties.
- DLC potential in underplayed styles where internal politics or diplomatic interactions take center stage
- Very likely that a DLC focusing on warfare and conflicts would be profitable as most players prefer engaging in this playstyle

## Files Included
